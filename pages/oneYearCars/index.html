                The first attempt at a luxury pickup truck was a failed attempt. Production started in August of 2001 and was 
                only sold in the US for the 2002 model year (though it was also sold for the 2003 model year in Mexico). 
                Only available in RWD configuration, and very few options, the Lincoln Blackwood missed sales projections 
                majorly. The bed was also not a standard truck bed, but it had a tonneau cover and a barn-style tailgate,
                as well as it being carpeted. This severely limited the blackwood's versatility, and it also being priced 
                at a MSRP at $52500, caused it to be a massive flop in the marketplace. A total of 3356 blackwoods were ever 
                made in the 15 months of production.

                S trim level. In addition there were several cosmetic differences on all 2003 models, notably being new

                When the 5th generation Mustang received a pretty big mid cycle refresh from the 2010 model year, the
                available engines were a carryover from the pre-facelift Mustangs. But in 2011, Ford replaced both the engines,
                with a 3.7L V6 now being the base engine, as well as the introduction of the Coyote 5.0L V8. The new 5.0L
                V8 made 97 more horsepower than the 4.6L V8 it replaced, and the 3.7L V6 made 95 more horsepower than the 4.0L 
                V6 it replaced. Nevertheless, this made the 2010 Mustang an oddball year as it had the new facelift body, but 
                with the carryover engines.

                in the US for 2021. Though the new generation of the K900 (K9 in some markets) was able to be sold for two model
                years (2019 and 2020), the Cadenza had just been facelifted for 2020, with more standard features, updated
                styling and a standard 12.3 inch touchscreen. This was a car which few people knew existed, and even fewer
                bought. The reason for the discontinuation of the Cadenza and its sibling the K900 was due to the rapidly shrinking
                market for large sedans and the introduction of the Genesis brand from Hyundai in 2017. In 2020, Kia managed to only
                sell 1,265 Cadenzas, and 305 K900s.

                economy than the previous 2.5L. In addition, Nissan also updated the CVT transmission which featured a wider
                gear ratio coverage, among other updates. But aside from the powertrain upgrade, the Rogue carried on unchanged.
